## Overview
This project leverages **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** for feature extraction and **LSTM networks** to classify spectrogram images into epilepsy, schizophrenia, or healthy cases. The model achieves **92% test accuracy** and a **0.98 AUC score**, demonstrating strong diagnostic potential.

---

## Features
- **Spectrogram Preprocessing**: Resizing and normalization of EEG-derived images.
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Wavelet-based feature extraction.  
  - Statistical features (mean, skewness, energy).  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for efficient feature compression.  
- **LSTM Model**: Sequential deep learning for time-series pattern recognition.  
- **Interpretability**: ROC curves, training/validation accuracy/loss plots.
